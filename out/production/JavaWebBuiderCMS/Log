// login/register system

AES ecryption and Email checker are working !
Please don't change the password, I spend 2 days to seek this fix.


Implement the algoritm to check user is verified or not with database!

Tested the login and register system after uptades are done:
    -do account and try to log in.

Find the new password for database:
    -that depend of me

Implement the Thread in the login form for sending the new codes after 30 secounds !!!!!!

The verification form is created;
After finished to implement all the login system, I will provide the Modern GUI with CSS (OR SASS if it is working better with JavaFX)!!
